# TweetHelper
## Overview
TweetHelper is a web app in which users can input the URL to any article page to view keywords from that article as hashtags. The user can then compose a custom tagged and linked Tweet for that article and post directly from the app. From there, the app builds a brand profile for the user as they post articles from the app.

## Background Information
This app was completed as my first project in the Galvanize Full Stack program in Denver, CO, USA. The bulk of this solo project was completed within 7 days after six weeks of instruction.
